* =fancy-yank=
Sometimes you just have to transform text from the clipboard before pasting it
into the buffer. For example, when inserting links to tickets, issues or pull
requests you might want to format them, so
https://github.com/d12frosted/fancy-yank/issue/1 becomes
[[https://github.com/d12frosted/fancy-yank/issue/1][d12frosted/fancy-yank#1]]. Are you doing it manually?

** Usage
In order to use this package, setup the value of =fancy-yank-rules= and use
=fancy-yank= to automatically apply transformations defined by these rules.

** Example setup
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq fancy-yank-rules
        '(
          ;; transform GitHub issue link to username/repo#number
          ("\\(https?://github.com/\\([[:alnum:]-]+\\)/\\([-[:alnum:]]+\\)/[[:alpha:]]+/\\([[:digit:]]+\\).*\\)" . "[[\\1][\\2/\\3#\\4]]")

          ;; append "FIX " to any other string
          (#'identity . (lambda (x) (concat "FIX " x)))
          ))
#+END_SRC

Please refer to =fancy-yank-rules= documentation for more information.
